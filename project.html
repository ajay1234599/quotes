    <h1>MAY I HELP YOU</h1>
  <img src="123.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:400px;height:350px;">
    <p>I KNOW MY FRIEND <br> YOU HAVE CAME THROUGH A ROUGH PATH DONT WORRY I AM HERE TO GIVE MY BEST<br>ITS NEVER TOO LATE TO START ,AND TOO EARLY TO QUIT</p>
    <H2>I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU</H2>
    <H3>The Obstacle In Our Path (Opportunity)</H3>
    <P>In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. He then hid himself and watched to see if anyone would move the boulder out of the way. Some of the king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.

Many people loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none of them did anything about getting the stone out of the way.<BR>

A peasant then came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to push the stone out of the road.<BR> After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.

After the peasant went back to pick up his vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been.

The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King explaining that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.<BR>
</P>
<H4>Moral of the story:</H4>
<P>Every obstacle we come across in life gives us an opportunity to improve our circumstances, and whilst the lazy complain, the others are creating opportunities through their kind hearts, generosity, and willingness to get things done.</P>

<h5>IF YOU ARE NOT CONVINCED...!<BR> I AM HAVING ONE MORE STORY TO TELL YOU</H5>
  <H6>Control Your Temper (Anger)</H6>
  <P>There once was a little boy who had a very bad temper. His father decided to hand him a bag of nails and said that every time the boy lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.

On the first day, the boy hammered 37 nails into that fence.

The boy gradually began to control his temper over the next few weeks, and the number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased.

He discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.

Finally, the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper under control.

The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.</P>
<H7>MORAL OF THE STORY:</H7>
<P1>Control your anger, and don’t say things to people in the heat of the moment, that you may later regret. Some things in life, you are unable to take back.

 </P1><BR><BR>
 <P2> TRY THIS ONE AS WELL:</P2>
 <H8>An Old Man Lived in the Village</H8>
 <P>An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.

The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.

He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.

But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened. Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour:
<BR>“An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles, and even his face is freshened up.”

 <BR>The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:

Villager: What happened to you?<BR>“Nothing special. Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.” – An Old Man

 <BR>MORAL:<BR>Don’t chase happiness. Enjoy your life.</P>
